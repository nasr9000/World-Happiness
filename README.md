# World-Happiness

Intro: I chose this to be my very first solo project because we currently face a mental health crisis around the world and I am looking to understand just exactly what are the most important factors that contribute to a country's overall happiness. I started by choosing this dataset as it had an abundance of countries to choose from as well as important variables that correlate heavily with an individual's well-being wherever they reside. I started by importing my dependencies and cleaning my dataframes to rid of any metrics that I was not interested in measuring for the project. I chose to use the .drop(columns=['']...) function to make my data frame concise. Following this, I decided to fix my decimals for my values in each respective variable I planned to incorporate by using the .round(decimals=2) at the end of my data frame function.
